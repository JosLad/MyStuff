# MyStuff
For this project, I had to make a file that would be able to calculate and display the compound interest over time based off of user inputs of initial money, money per month, interest rate, and the length of time for the interest to grow. I made a clock class and made functions to display, calculate, and operate the program. Per the requirements, I used exceptions to handle most of the errors that may happen during the runtime of the program. The hardest thing for me to implement was exceptions as I do not have a lot of experience with them, but I was able to make it work. Overall this took less time than my first project to complete. I could have also improved my code by using exceptions for all of the possible errors instead of just most of them. There was a lot of math involved with this that would be useful moving forward for methods of getting the numbers correct. I think I did that part of the project pretty well, as it was confusing at first but I got it. Using a class and encapsulation of the functions helps my project to be more secure and maintainable.
